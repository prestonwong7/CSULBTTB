## What is this?
CSULB Table Tennis &amp; Badminton Software is an application created by me to quickly make sign in much more easier for students in the club. During fall semester, there were many students & non students who joined the club that didn't pay the club fee. With this software, every club member will now have to sign in and register, or use a one day pass. All sign in's will be uploaded into a google sheet that will keep track everyone who signs in.

# Procedures and Goals
## Software
1. Make list of all members
2. Each members have PAID(GREEN)/UNPAID(RED)
## Graphical Interface
3. Date: MM/DD/YYYY
4. Have a dropdown box of all user names.
5. Two boxes: Sign in / One day ($2.00)
## Software
6. Upload into Google Sheets

# How to use this?
1. Three options: Sign in, Register, One Day
2. Sign in option has a dropbox of all the members. User will just need to click their own name and press sign in. It will then either say PAID or UNPAID.
3. Register option adds new user as a member (unpaid)
4. One Day will tell the user to pay the treasurer the One Day Pass fee.
